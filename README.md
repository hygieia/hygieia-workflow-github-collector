<h3>How are Workflows Organized?</h3>
<ul>
  Each GitHub repository can contain multiple workflows
  There can be one or more "run" associated with each workflow
  There can be one or more "job" associated with each run
  There can be one or more "step" within each job
</ul>

<h3>Technical Description</h3>
  The Classes and their description
<ul>
  WorkflowController: Exposes APIs for UI to get the Component Data
  WorkflowCollectorTask : As with the framework , implementing Collector Task to regularly collect the workflow details and feed into the MongoDb
  WorkflowServiceImpl: To populate the componentData model and send back to UI
  Workflow*Repository: Provides CRUD operations to elements in the MongoDb
